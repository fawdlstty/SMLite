WHAT IS THIS
This directory holds a library for using standard vector list map set stack queue etc in a pure C environment.
All those of concepts in tstl2cl are inspired by STL. You could have a look at http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/index.html 
to know about C++ Standard Template Library i.e STL.

WHEN TO USE 
Make sure that you are working in a C environment rather than C++ or anything else before going on reading.
If you get boring with writing basic data struct and algorithm again and agagin in C, tstl2cl would probably be the very 
library kits for you. It will save you much of time of coding, then you could focus more on your applications' function. 
  
HOW TO USE
Read documents in 'doc' folder, and many a samples could be found in 'test' folder. If you are familiar with STL, you would 
probably find that to use this library is a snap.
 
TO BUILD SAMPLES
On linux 
make clean all
On cygwin
make -f Makefile.win clean all
You may have some problems to build this library in some minority C compiler, feel free to fix them. You could also report 
bugs on the project's website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tstl2cl.
